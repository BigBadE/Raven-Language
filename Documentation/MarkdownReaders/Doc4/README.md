# Control Flow

Control Flow is how we use different statements to control the flow of the program. What does that mean? Well, lets look at an example:
What if we wanted to run some code only if a number is less than 5? Let's try it:
```
import stdio;

fn main() {
    let value = 7;
    if value < 5 {
        printf("Yep!");
    } else {
        printf("Nope!");
    }
}
```

Let's run the code with various values:
```
value | output
------+-------
  7   | Nope!
  6   | Nope!
  5   | Nope!
  4   | Yep!
```

So, if the value is less than 5, only the code in the ``if`` statement runs. If the value is greater than or equal to 5, than the code
in the ``else`` statement runs. We can expand this with the ``else if`` statement:

```
import stdio;

fn main() {
    let value = 7;
    if value < 5 {
        printf("Yep!");
    } else if value == 5 {
        printf("Five!");
    } else {
        printf("Nope!");
    }
}
```


Let's run the code with the same values:
```
value | output
------+-------
  7   | Nope!
  6   | Nope!
  5   | Five!
  4   | Yep!
```

Following alone with the code, we can label each statement:
(This code will NOT compile, it is purely for comprehension)

```
import stdio;

fn main() {
    let value = 7;
    1: if value < 5 {
        printf("Yep!");
    2: } else if value == 5 {
        printf("Five!");
    3: } else {
        printf("Nope!");
    }
}
```

The logic is as follows:

1 is checked. IF value is less than 5, THEN Yep! is printed and nothing else happens.
2 is checked IF 1 failed. IF value equals 5, THEN Five! is printed and nothing else happens.
IF 1 and 2 failed, THEN Nope! is printed and nothing else happens.

If the logic doesn't make sense, feel free to mess around with the code on your own.

Once, you understand control flow, it's time to learn functions. [Chapter 4: Functions](4_functions.md)
